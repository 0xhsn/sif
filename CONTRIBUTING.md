## Reporting issues

If you believe you've found a bug, or you have a new feature to request, please hop on the [IRC channel](https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=#sif) first to discuss it.  
This way, if it's an easy fix, we could help you solve it more quickly, and if it's a feature request we could workshop it together into something more mature.

When opening an issue, please use the search tool and make sure that the issue has not been discussed before. In the case of a bug report, run sif with the `-d/-debug` flag for full debug logs.

## Contributing code

### Development

To develop sif, you'll need version 1.20 or later of the Go toolchain. After making your changes, run the program using `go run ./cmd/sif` to make sure it compiles and runs properly.

*Nix users:* the repository provides a flake that can be used to develop and run sif. Use `nix run`, `nix develop`, `nix build`, etc. Make sure to run `gomod2nix` if `go.mod` is changed.

### Submitting a pull request

When making a pull request, please adhere to the following conventions:

- sif adheres to the Go style guidelines. Always format your gode with `gofmt`.
- When adding/removing imports, make sure to use `go mod tidy`, and then run `gomod2nix` to generate the Nix-readable module list.
- Set `git config pull.rebase true` to rebase commits on pull instead of creating ugly merge commits.
- Title your commits in present tense, in the imperative style.
  - You may use prefixes like `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `deps`, etc.  
    **Example:** `deps: update gopkg.in/yaml.v3 to v3.0.1`
  - You may use prefixes to denote the part of the code changed in the commit.  
    **Example:** `pkg/scan: ignore 3xx redirects`
  - If not using a prefix, make sure to use sentence case.  
    **Example:** `Add nuclei template parsing support`
  - If applicable, provide a helpful commit description, listing usage notes, implementation details, and tasks that still need to be done.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask around on the IRC channel.

## Packaging

We'd love it if you helped us bring sif to your distribution.
The repository provides a Makefile for building and packaging sif for any distro; consult your distribution's documentation for details.
